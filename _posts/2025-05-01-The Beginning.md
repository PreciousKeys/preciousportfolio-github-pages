I had a meeting last night with a cybersecurity associate of mine that is helping me complete this project. Unfortunately after troubleshooting the problem it looks like I will have to either unistall the software from my laptop or will have to scale back my pc from a backup that did not contain the program itself. The main problem occurred when I tried to connect the endpoints. The endpoints themselves tried to connect to the software via the private keys, however the private keys were not found which resulted in the failed connections. 

How was the problem found?: 
1) 2 different endpoints were trying to connect to the system and failed. I initially directed the endpoints to the host computer, I learned via my assoicate that this was not possible. After trying and failing to connect to two different endpoints I had to look deeper.
2) The Windows log file showed a failed connection due to the private keys not being found.

Tips:
1) Check Your Logggggs!!!!!!!!!!!!
2) Troubleshoot
